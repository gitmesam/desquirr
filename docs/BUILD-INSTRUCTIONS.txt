Build instructions for desquirr

PREREQUISITES:
    * expects IDA to be installed in c:\local\ida500
    * expects the http://www.boost.org library to be installed in c:\local\boost\boost_1_33_0
    * the http://www.cygwin.com tools are installed
    * the microsoft compiler.

I have not tried building desquirr with the watcom or borland compilers

PATCH SDK
    * in the IDASDK, in 'include/intel.hpp', change the line
       line: #include "../idaidp.hpp"
       into: #include "idaidp.hpp"

BUILDING:

with makefile.gnu
    * run 'vcvars32.bat'  to setup the environment variables for the msvc compiler
    * run 'make -f makefile.gnu'   to build the plugin
    * run 'make -f makefile.gnu install'  to install the plugin in the ida plugins directory.

with visualstudio
    * load desquirr.sln in visualstudio 2003
    * build solution

TROUBLESHOOTING:
    * link gives an error message:  LINK: extra operand `/export:PLUGIN'
      -> this means you did not run the vcvars32.bat file, and the gnu link was found
         instead of microsoft's link
